"""
This module can be used as a library for the command line interface
`emb_my_gbk`, or as an independent python script. It takes an arbitrarily
complicated Genbank flat file (we tested on a Geneious Prime-exported file
with many added annotations and feature qualifiers) and converts it to a
clean, barebones EMBL file. It can optionally convert this EMBL file with
additional restrictions to the Immuno-Polymorphism Database flavor of the
EMBL format.

    Corrects the placement of allele identifiers in sequence records exported
    from Geneious Prime.

    Geneious Prime sometimes places allele names in a location that does not
    conform to expected standards for certain analyses or database submissions.
    This function addresses the issue by relocating the allele name from its original
    position to both the record's ID and accession fields. It ensures that the allele
    name is consistently represented across the sequence record, facilitating proper
    identification and reference.

    Args:
        record (SeqRecord): The sequence record to be corrected. This `SeqRecord` object,
        as defined by the Biopython library, represents a single sequence and its associated
        data. The record is expected to have an allele name as part of its naming convention,
        which will be utilized to update the ID and accession fields.

    Returns:
        SeqRecord: The modified `SeqRecord` object with the allele name correctly positioned
        within the ID and accession annotations. This adjustment ensures that the allele name
        is prominently and correctly displayed in the record, aligning with standard practices
        for sequence identification.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the allele name is not properly propagated to the accession annotation
        after the function's execution, an AssertionError is raised. This serves as a check to
        ensure that the intended modifications have been successfully applied to the sequence
        record.

    Example:
        >>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
        >>> from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
        >>> original_record = SeqRecord(Seq("AGTC"), id="geneious_id", name="Allele_A1")

    Assigns a specified species name to the sequence record.

    This function updates the 'organism' annotation within the `SeqRecord` object
    to reflect the specified species' scientific name. This is particularly useful
    for ensuring consistency in species annotation across multiple sequence records,
    especially when preparing data for analysis or database submission.

    Args:
        record (SeqRecord): The sequence record to be updated. This is a `SeqRecord`
        object as defined by the Biopython library which represents a single sequence

        name of the species to be assigned to the sequence record. This name is used
        to update the 'organism' field within the record's annotations, ensuring that
        the record accurately reflects the specified species.

    Returns:
        SeqRecord: The modified `SeqRecord` object with the 'organism' annotation updated
        to the specified species' scientific name. This ensures that the sequence record

        applications.

def remove_geneious_annotations(record: SeqRecord) -> SeqRecord:

    Removes Geneious-specific annotations from a sequence record.

    Geneious software is known to add certain annotations to sequence records that may not
    be desired in all contexts. This function specifically targets and removes:

    1. "misc_feature" features that Geneious adds, often related to manual editing history.
    2. "/note" qualifiers within any feature, which can include comments or metadata added
    by Geneious.

    The removal of these annotations can help in simplifying the sequence record for downstream
    analysis or for submission to databases where such annotations are not required or could
    cause confusion.

    Args:
        record (SeqRecord): The sequence record from which Geneious-specific annotations are
            to be removed. The record should be a SeqRecord object as defined by the Biopython
            library, potentially containing features and qualifiers added by Geneious software.

    Returns:
        SeqRecord: The same SeqRecord object passed as input, but modified to remove Geneious-
            specific annotations. Specifically, all "misc_feature" features are removed, and any
            "note" qualifiers within other features are deleted. This ensures the record is cleaner
            and more compliant with general sequence record standards.

    Example:
        >>> from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord

        desired.

    Writes sequence records to an output file in a specified format, with

    This function supports writing the sequence records to a file in various
    formats. It includes options for creating an intermediate file for review
    and handling special format requirements such as ID line replacements in EMBL
    files for IPC entries.

    Args:
        records (List[SeqRecord]): A list of SeqRecord objects to be written to the file.
        final_out (str): The path for the output file.
        requested_format (str): The desired format for the output file (e.g., 'EMBL',
        'IPD_EMBL', 'GENBANK', 'FASTA').
        view_intermediate (bool): Whether to create and view an intermediate file before
        final output. Useful for debugging or intermediate analysis.

    The function adapts to the requested format, providing flexibility in output file
    generation and format-specific handling.
